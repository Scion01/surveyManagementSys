# surveyManagementSys
This is a survey management system application that we built for Smart India Hackathon for ministry of water resources.
We placed 4th and won 10K prize money for this.
It uses firebase database and firebase storage for uploading geo tagged images.
The images are geo tagged and these are visible on the backend with the location on the maps using google maps API.
